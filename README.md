# library-ITS

The objective of this project is to develop a library of functions in several languages, so as to be able to reuse these functions directly in other projects without having to recode them.

## Conventions

If you want to add new libraries in this project, please follow the conventions used for each language (see README in each directory). For all languages, you must comment your functions in English (no French). Your functions and variables also have to be in English.

## Requirement

All your functions must be tested (at least make an example to explain how to use your library). A README is also required to explain what is done and how to use the library.
